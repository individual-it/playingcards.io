A version of the game, that I know from my home-town (Detmold in Germany)
- the 1 is the highest card in the game (basically a 15 - to confuse less this deck does not have a 1 but a 15)
- the 1 (or now 15) has 15 points
- the rook is always trump-color (indicated in this deck by the word ROOK written in all colors)
- the rook is the least powerful card in the game, it can be overturned by a 2 (of the trump color, because it always becomes the trump color)
  (indicated in this deck by the 0 around the word ROOK)
